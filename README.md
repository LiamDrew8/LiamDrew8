### Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub.

To see my work with Machine Learning, please see the following project:

[Classifying Sentiment]([https://github.com/LiamDrew8/ClassifyingSentiment])
In this project, my partner and I classified product reviews as having either a positive or negative sentiment.
We represented our text reviews with BERT embeddings and used Logistic Regression to classify reviews as positive or negative.
